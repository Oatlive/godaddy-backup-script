Automatically Backup GoDaddy Files and Databases
================================================

Script built to backup Go Daddy websites and their databases on a shared host. Also, with a slight modification, the script should also work for any other host.

Make sure to fill the "Configuration" section before running the script.

In order to run the script automatically, a cron job needs be setup. To setup a Cron job, go to your Web Hosting Panel, and search for "Cron Job Manager". Create a new cron job, and choose how often do you want the backup to occur.
